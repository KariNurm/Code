# Meal App

An app for searching meal recipes.
<br></br>

## Description

My goal for the app is to make a simple search app with various filters for meal recipes using a meal api.
Personal goal is to improve on front- and backend developement and react state management.

For this project I used StackBlitz and TheMealDB.com.

## Todo:

### Frontend: &#x2611;
- overall styling &#x2611;
- search &#x2611;

### Backend: &#x2611;
  - fetch &#x2611;
  - handle states &#x2611;
  - handle clicks &#x2611;
  
### Updates:

1. Project started with category listing and some basic css  for developement.

2. Added some structure. Having trouble with the fetch.

3. Fixed fetch problems and added random meal page. Data is still rudimentary displayed for now.

4. Added an element for single meal with image, incredients, and instructions. Imported a fancier font.

5. Search lists result elements, added some css.

6. Added some css, category list elements work as links now and opens a list of meals.

6. Added modal popup for a meal in the meal category list and css grid for the meal element, also some overall css. 

## Conclucion

The project is pretty much done. Of course there could are features that could be added, like search filters and parameters and more cool and responsive css, but I think it served itÂ´s purpouse. 

Project helped me understand/reaffirm my skills in hooks, routes, modals and backend fecthing of data.
