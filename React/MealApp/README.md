# Meal App

An app for searching meal recipes.
<br></br>

## Description

My goal for the app is to make a simple search app with various filters for meal recipes using a meal api.
Personal goal is to improve on front- and backend developement and react state management.

For this project I used StackBlitz and TheMealDB.com.

## Todo:

### Frontend: &#x2610;

- search &#x2610;
- filter &#x2610;

### Backend: &#x2610;
  - fetch &#x2610;
  
### Updates:

1. Project started with category listing and some basic css  for developement.
