# Meal App

An app for searching meal recipes.
<br></br>

## Description

My goal for the app is to make a simple search app with various filters for meal recipes using a meal api.
Personal goal is to improve on front- and backend developement and react state management.

For this project I used StackBlitz and TheMealDB.com.

## Todo:

### Frontend: &#x2610;

- search &#x2610;
- filter &#x2610;

### Backend: &#x2610;
  - fetch &#x2610;
  
### Updates:

1. Project started with category listing and some basic css  for developement.

2. Added some structure. Having trouble with the fetch.

3. Fixed fetch problems and added random meal page. Data is still rudimentary displayed for now.

4. Added an element for single meal with image, incredients, and instructions. Imported a fancier font.

5. Search lists result elements, added some css.
